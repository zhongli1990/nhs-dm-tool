# Release Notes v0.2.4

Date: 2026-02-27

## Summary

v0.2.4 finalizes enterprise governance hardening for the OpenLI DMM control plane by introducing migration-managed schema control and immutable audit events for critical operational actions.

## Key updates

1. Schema governance via Alembic
- Added Alembic migration framework for backend database lifecycle management.
- Added baseline migration chain for enterprise schema creation and controlled evolution.
- Backend startup now runs `alembic upgrade head` when DB-backed modes are enabled.

2. Migration-first database operations
- Shifted to migration-first schema management (`DM_SCHEMA_AUTOCREATE=false` by default).
- Retained emergency fallback schema autocreate mode behind explicit configuration.

3. Immutable audit event trail
- Added PostgreSQL `audit_events` table and indexes.
- Added audit capture for mission-critical actions, including:
  - authentication success/denial
  - registration requests and reviews
  - context switches
  - org/workspace/project creation actions
- Added secured audit retrieval API:
  - `GET /api/audit/events` (org admin / super admin scope)

4. Versioning/documentation alignment
- Updated version manifest and app metadata to `0.2.4`.
- Updated runtime and deployment documentation to reflect migration and audit controls.

## Runtime verification

- Docker stack healthy:
  - frontend `9133`
  - backend `9134`
  - nginx `9135`
  - postgres `9136`
- Alembic migrations verified in backend startup logs.
- Auth, mappings, quality, and audit APIs verified after rebuild.
- Audit records confirmed persisted in PostgreSQL.
