# Release Notes v0.2.5

Date: 2026-02-28

## Summary

v0.2.5 consolidates enterprise user governance and documentation operations for OpenLI DMM, while moving versioning to a single manifest-driven source consumed consistently by backend and UI.

## Key updates

1. Consolidated version governance
- `services/version_manifest.json` is the single source of truth for product version and release history.
- Backend version metadata and `GET /api/meta/version` are manifest-backed.
- Login, register, top-bar, and settings surfaces now resolve runtime version from API metadata rather than hardcoded labels.

2. Enterprise user management and RBAC uplift
- User lifecycle operations and role assignment controls aligned with enterprise admin workflows.
- Role and permission matrix baseline integrated in UI/API.
- Audit-backed identity and RBAC mutation traceability retained.

3. Documentation operations module
- Added `/documents` operations page for platform documentation browsing.
- Markdown rendering and controlled upload/download path integrated with RBAC and audit behavior.

4. Product documentation revision
- Updated product, lifecycle, user guide, and RBAC design/plan/status documentation for v0.2.5 baseline.
- Added dedicated implementation status record for enterprise user management and RBAC.

## Compatibility and deployment notes

1. Docker and non-Docker (Windows Server manual) deployment models remain supported.
2. Host port policy unchanged (`9133-9139`).
3. Existing migration/Alembic startup behavior remains in place.
