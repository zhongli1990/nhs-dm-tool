# Release Notes v0.2.3

Date: 2026-02-27

## Summary

v0.2.3 advances enterprise persistence hardening for mission-critical NHS PAS data migration operations by completing PostgreSQL-backed identity and runtime state for core control-plane workflows.

## Key updates

1. Login hardening
- Removed hardcoded prefilled credentials from login UI.
- Updated login form behavior for enterprise-safe credential entry.

2. PostgreSQL-backed identity and RBAC
- Auth domain now persisted in PostgreSQL:
  - users
  - organizations
  - workspaces
  - projects
  - organization memberships
  - registration requests
  - role permissions
- JWT payload now includes resolved permissions for authorization consistency.

3. PostgreSQL-backed runtime control-plane state
- Runtime state moved from file JSON into PostgreSQL (with fallback mode retained):
  - mapping workbench
  - quality KPI configuration
  - quality trend history

4. Environment and deployment controls
- Added explicit backend mode controls:
  - `DM_AUTH_BACKEND`
  - `DM_STATE_BACKEND`
- Added bootstrap admin credential environment settings.

5. Documentation updates
- Updated operational docs and credential guidance to reflect DB-backed behavior and secure defaults.

## Runtime verification

- Docker stack healthy on constrained ports:
  - frontend: 9133
  - backend: 9134
  - nginx: 9135
  - postgres: 9136
- API smoke checks passed for login, auth context, mappings, quality KPIs, and trend persistence.
- PostgreSQL table population verified for auth/RBAC and runtime state entities.
