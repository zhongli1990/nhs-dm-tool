# Source PAS Data Dictionary Notes

## Implementation Update (v0.0.2)

The source data dictionary requirements are now represented in the migration product runtime with:

1. Source schema catalog extraction and dynamic UI rendering.
2. Source-to-target semantic mapping and strict mapping contract generation.
3. Contract-driven ETL and enterprise quality gates.
4. UI lifecycle execution controls for end-to-end DM runs.

The operational UI and backend CLI are synchronized through shared pipeline execution and shared report outputs.
